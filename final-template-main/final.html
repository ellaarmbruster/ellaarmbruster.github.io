			<p>Despite similar demands and expectations, a significant gap remains in the salaries of head coaches for men’s and women’s teams, highlighting ongoing disparities in sports equity. 

According to Equity in Athletics data, head coaches of NCAA Division I men’s teams in the ACC earn an average salary of $1.3 million. While this number varies by school, most head coaches of men’s teams in the conference make over $1 million. In comparison, head coaches of NCAA Division I women’s teams in the ACC earn an average of $320,000, less than a quarter of their male counterparts' salaries. Additionally, assistant coaches of men’s teams at ACC schools still make more money than the head coaches of women’s programs.

			<p>One of the most significant factors in determining a head coach’s salary is the revenue generated by their team or program. Don Regan, co-founder and financial manager of several former sporting leagues, such as World Team Tennis, the World Hockey Association, and the American Basketball Association, has experience managing both men’s and women’s teams and has provided insight into a coach’s salary.</p>

		<section>

				<p>“It really comes down to how much money a team is making, and for a long time, men’s sports dominated media attention and TV time, which allowed more money to be paid to their staff. But, women’s sports are starting to see an increase in popularity, and it’ll be interesting to see how and if schools will reflect this in salaries and contracts.”</p>

				<p>Head coaches of women’s teams in the NCAA typically earn around $260,000. However, exceptions exist for women’s basketball coaches Kim Mulkey and Dawn Staley, who lead powerhouse programs with winning reputations and large fan followings, earning salaries of $3 million. These achievements, however, have not come without challenges. Dawn Staley, head coach of the University of South Carolina’s women’s basketball team, had to advocate for a higher salary after recognizing that her compensation did not reflect her success or align with her peers. This showcases the issue that female coaches often find themselves undervalued even with exceptional athletic accomplishments and must fight for fair pay. </p>

					<p>For example, South Carolina’s women’s basketball program generates the most revenue in NCAA women’s basketball at <a href="https://www.2adays.com/blog/top-10-division-i-basketball-programs-by-revenue/" target="_blank">$9.5 million</a> annually, yet UConn’s head coach, Geno Auriemma, remains the highest-paid women’s basketball coach with a salary of $3.7 million, despite UConn generating slightly less revenue at $8.5 million per year. While Dawn Staley’s salary has increased through her advocacy, the disparity remains, illustrating the ongoing inequities in compensation.</p>

				<p>Revenue disparities between men’s and women’s NCAA teams remain significant. Men’s teams generated an average of $105 million at the four ACC schools analyzed, while women’s teams brought in about $18 million.</p>

<p>This revenue gap significantly contributes to the salary inequity between men’s and women’s teams’ head coaches.</p>

<p>Women’s athletic programs often struggle to generate the same income level as men’s, which places financial constraints on universities. These institutions frequently invest more money into these programs than they earn to cover essential expenses, including travel, recruitment, equipment, team meals, and other operational costs. This financial strain further limits the ability to pay women’s team head coaches salaries comparable to those of men’s teams.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the combination of lower revenue and higher expenses creates a challenging environment for equitable funding, impacting salaries and resources across women’s NCAA sports.</p>

<p>A discrepancy between head coaches of men’s and women’s team’s salaries is not the only problem that gender equity in college athletics faces. Despite the significant wage disparities, the job responsibilities of head coaches of men’s and women’s teams are virtually identical. Both roles require a focus on player and skill development, recruiting top talent, hiring and managing support staff, coordinating schedules, and many more duties. However, regardless of these shared demands, there is still a significant imbalance between the number of men and women occupying head coaching jobs. In the NCAA, more than half of women’s college teams are led by male head coaches, while female head coaches are almost entirely absent from men’s teams.</p>

<p>Efforts to address gender equity in college athletics, particularly through Title IX, have made strides in providing equal opportunities for participation, scholarship funding, and competitive experiences for male and female athletes. However, <a href="https://usafacts.org/articles/men-far-outnumber-women-on-coaching-staffs-in-college-sports/">Title IX </a> does not include regulations to ensure gender equity or compensation in coaching roles. Therefore, this salary gap highlights a lingering inequity that needs to be addressed in the push for fairness in collegiate sports.</p>

<p>As women’s sports gain popularity quickly with increased fan engagement and media coverage, universities can address the financial disparities by reevaluating their salary structures. Giving women’s teams head coaches a more equitable compensation would reflect the growing success and visibility of women’s sports and support long-term sustainability for these programs. </p>
